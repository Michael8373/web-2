      <h2>Missionary : Mary Slessor</h2>
      <p>Mary Slessor, 1848-1915, was a Scottish Presbyterian missionary to Africa. She made a huge impact on Nigeria and beyond. One source claims “much of West Africa was evangelised due to the open door that Mary Slessor created for the next generation of missionaries to follow after her. Today, hospitals, schools, orphanages and churches all stand because of the impact Mary Slessor left in West Africa.”</p>
      <h3>How she made a difference</h3>
      <p>Mary Slessor made a difference primarily through her dedication to rescuing twins and abandoned children, promoting women's rights, and spreading the gospel in Nigeria, particularly in the Okoyong region. She also became a mediator in disputes, acting as a vice-consul and even a magistrate, influencing local culture and the British colonial government. </p>
